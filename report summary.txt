Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 

30 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Total Concurrent API requested: 120.
50 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Total Concurrent API requested: 200.
80 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Total Concurrent API requested: 320.
85 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Total Concurrent API requested: 340.
While executed 85 concurrent request,  found error rate is 0.59%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 330 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
